# Exploratory Data Analysis on the Adult Demographic Data dataset

This project is a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Adult Demographic dataset. The goal was to uncover insights, identify patterns, and understand the structure of the data through visualizations and summary statistics. My secondary goal was to test myself in Python as I am a relatively new learner and wanted to make sure I understood the syntax and the logic of EDA processes and dealing with data. 

##  Project Summary

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.
- Performed standard analysis.
- Answered random questions about the dataset to test myself 
  

##  Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Files

- `demo.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook.
- `demographic_data_analyzer.py`: Final notebook for analysis
- `README.md`: Project description

##  Notes

This project was done as part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate basic EDA skills using Python. This was also a test for myself to make sure I can perform analysis tasks in python and remember the syntax and structure and such.
